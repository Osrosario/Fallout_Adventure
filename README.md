# What is this?
This project was completed to fufill an assignment for my Programming and Problem-solving course at Quinnipiac University. After learning how to create functions in Scala, the students were required to apply their own functions to develop a project of their choice.

# Story
*Fallout Adventure* is a text-based adventure game based off Bethesda's *Fallout* series where the player exits his/her vault to explore the radiation-filled landscape. The story is written using the "Strings of Pearl" story-telling method that has branching paths but concludes to a single ending. The player will have the choice to 
explore other locations and aqcuire items that will aid them in their journey. Encounters with the radiated wild life are inevitable and the player 
must fight their way to their destination.

# Features
This game features a round-based battle system where the player and the opposing NPC (non-playable character) will take turns choosing actions. The player has the choice to attack, defend, heal, or flee battle. If the player's health reaches zero or below, the game will end. This game also includes an inventory system where the player can view their respective character stats, obtain, use, manage, and discard items.

# How To Play:
- Use any text editor or IDE that supports, compiles, and executes the Scala programming language and simply run the script.
